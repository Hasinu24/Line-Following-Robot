# Line-Following-Robot
Line Following Robot ðŸš—
This repository contains the implementation of a Line Following Robot using Aseba language and Thonny IDE. The robot is designed to detect and follow a line, while dynamically responding to obstacles using proximity sensors and motor control.

ðŸ›  Features
Line Following Algorithm: Based on proportional (P) or proportional-integral (PI) control.
Proximity Sensor Integration: Detects objects using multiple proximity sensors for better accuracy.
Motor Control: Smooth forward, backward, and turning motions using real-time feedback.
State Machine Logic: Efficiently manages robot states like line following, obstacle detection, and recovery.
ðŸ”§ Hardware Components
Proximity Sensors:
prox.horizontal[0] to prox.horizontal[4]: Used to detect lines and obstacles.
Motors:
Left and right motors controlled using target values.
Power Supply:
Rechargeable batteries for powering the robot.
Controller:
Thymio robot or any Aseba-compatible device.

ðŸ§  How It Works
Key Algorithms
Bang-Bang Control:

Compares the reference value with the sensor reading and adjusts the motor targets abruptly (e.g., full speed forward or full stop).
Simple and fast but less precise.
Proportional-Integral (PI) Control:

Adjusts motor power based on the error (difference between reference and measured values) and the accumulated error over time.
Offers smoother and more precise control.
State Machine Logic:

State 1: Line following.
State 2: Obstacle detection.
State 3: Recovery behavior when off-path.
ðŸ§ª Observations
Bang-Bang Control:

The robot stops abruptly near objects and reverses.
Effective for simple tasks but results in jerky motion.
PI Control:

The robot smoothly slows down as it approaches obstacles and stops accurately.
Achieves better error management and smoother navigation.
State Machine:

Handles multiple scenarios effectively by transitioning between states like line following, obstacle detection, and recovery.
ðŸ“Š Results
Plots:
Plots show the robotâ€™s error and speed variations during line following.
PI control has less error variance compared to Bang-Bang control.
ðŸš€ Future Improvements
Add PID Control: Enhance control by integrating a derivative term for smoother transitions.
Computer Vision: Use a camera for advanced line detection and navigation.
IoT Integration: Monitor and control the robot remotely using IoT.
Obstacle Avoidance: Combine line following with dynamic obstacle avoidance using additional sensors.
